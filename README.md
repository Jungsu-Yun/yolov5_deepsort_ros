## Introduction
This repository implements ROS packages to detect objects using `ROS`, `yolov5`, and to classify and track single objects using `Deepport algorithms`.
The source code of this repository is as follows.

## Before You Run Node
### 1. Configuring the Python3 environment for ROS Melodic
* YoloV5 runs in `Python 3 environments`. Therefore, before running the package, you must configure the node using Python 3 to run in the `ROS Medloic environment`.
    ```s
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-all-dev python3-yaml python3-rospkg
    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-desktop-full --fix-missing
    sudo pip3 install rospkg catkin_pkg
    ```
* Error occurs when using `cv_bridge` in python3 environment. Therefore, you should rebuild the `cv_bridge` according to the melodic version.
    ```s
    sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools python3-catkin-pkg-modules
    # Create catkin workspace
    mkdir catkin_workspace
    cd catkin_workspace
    catkin init
    
    # Instruct catkin to set cmake variables
    catkin config -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.6m -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6m.so
    
    # Instruct catkin to install built packages into install place. It is $CATKIN_WORKSPACE/install folder
    catkin config --install
    
    # Clone cv_bridge src
    git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv.git src/vision_opencv
    
    # Find version of cv_bridge in your repository
    apt-cache show ros-melodic-cv-bridge | grep Version
        Version: 1.13.0-0bionic.20210505.032238
    
    # Checkout right version in git repo. In our case it is 1.13.0
    cd src/vision_opencv/
    git checkout 1.13.0
    cd ../../
    
    # Build
    catkin build cv_bridge
    
    # Extend environment with new package
    echo "source install/setup.bash --extend" >> bashrc
    ```

### 2. ROS Node Package Download
* Run clone with a repository that is dependent.
    ```s
    cd your_workspace/src
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jungsuyun/yolov5_deepsort_ros.git
    cd ..
    catkin_make
    ```
    If you did not do `--recurse-submodules`, you must run `git submodule update --init`.
* Ensure that all dependency information in Node is met. The package works with Python 3.6 or later and requires several dependency packages to be installed.
    ```s
    pip3 install "numpy>=1.18.5,<1.20" "matplotlib>=3.2.2,<4"
    pip3 install yolov5
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
* Github [prevents you from uploading more than 100MB of files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/working-with-large-files/conditions-for-large-files). Therefore, you should download the weight file associated with Deepport.
* [Download the Depsort-specific weight file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xhG0kRH1EX5B9_Iz8gQJb7UNnn_riXi6). Download the ckpt.t7 file to the path `scripts/deep_sort_pytorch/deep_sort/deep/checkpoint/`.

## Run YoloV5 Deepsort Node
### 1. Run Detection Node
* The yolov5 detection node runs as follows:

    ```s
    roslaunch yolov5_deepsort detector.launch
    ```
    
    By default, the image topic that performs detection is `/image_raw`. If you want to change the Subscribe image topic, you need to modify the following part of `detector.launch`.

    ```xml
    <arg name="image_topic"	                default="/image_raw"/>
    ```
    If you want to detect only one or a few objects, not multiple objects, you need to modify the following parts of `detector.launch`. If you want to detect the entire class, you must enter None, and if you want to detect only a specific class, you must enter the class name.
    ```xml
    <arg name="class_name"                  default='None'/>
    <!-- <arg name="class_name"                  default='person'/> -->
    ```

### 2. Run Deep Sort Node
* yolov5 depthort node runs as follows:

    ```s
    roslaunch yolov5_deepsort tracker.launch
    ```
    
    By default, the image topic that performs detection is `/image_raw`. If you want to change the Subscribe image topic, you need to modify the following part of `detector.launch`.

    ```xml
    <arg name="image_topic"	                default="/image_raw"/>
    ```
    The initial value of the class that performs tracking is `person`. If you want to track another class, you need to modify the next part of 'detector.launch'.
    ```xml
    <arg name="class_name"                  default='person'/>
    ```

### 3. Subscribe Topic
* [/image_raw](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html) : Subscribe Image topic to detect objects.

### 4. Published Topic
* [/detected_objects_in_image](https://github.com/jungsuyun/yolov5_deepsort_ros/blob/melodic/msg/BoundingBox.msg)
    * string Class
    * float64 probability
    * int64 xmin
    * int64 ymin
    * int64 xmax
    * int64 ymax
* [/detections_image_topic](https://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html) : Issue Image topic with bounding box, class name entered.

## TroubleShooting
#### ImportError: dynamic module does not define module export function (PyInit_cv_bridge_boost)
This error occurs when a python package related to cv_bridge_boost is not found. Open the cv_bridge/CMakelist.txt file in the folder where you installed the cv_bridge package and modify `found_package(Boost REQUIRED python3)` as follows:
```CMake
find_package(Boost REQUIRED python3-py36)
```
Then build and run cv_bridge again.

#### ImportError: cannot import name 'BoundingBox'
This error is caused by not building yolov5_deepport package. Go to catkin_ws, `catkin_make` and run the package again.
